Versions for MuseScore v3
=========================

These are ports of the plugins to MuseScore v3.
**However, they don't yet work with the current releases of MuseScore 3,**
since the plugin framework lacks some needed functionality in v3.

If you want to try the plugins, you'll need to self-compile MuseScore and include [this PR](https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore/pull/4631).
