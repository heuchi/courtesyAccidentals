courtesyAccidentals
===================

Two plugins for MuseScore version 2.0 to add or remove courtesy accidentals.

These plugins are still under development. If you use them, make sure to
safe your work. There's no guarantee the plugins won't corrupt your score.

If you prefer courtesy accidentals to be in brackets change line 29 of
addCourtesyAccidentals.qml to:

    property bool useBracket: true

If you have comments and/or suggestions, please tell me.

---

There's a third plugin now: configCourtesyAccidentals.qml
This plugin also adds courtesy accidentals but can be configured via a dialog
window, that pops up when the plugin is called.
It is currently under development.
