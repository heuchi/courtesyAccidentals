courtesyAccidentals
===================

A plugin for MuseScore that adds and removes courtesy accidentals

I planned this to be one plugin, however, under the current
development status of MuseScore that seems not possible. So I changed
it to be two plugins, which might be better anyway...

These plugins are still under development. You can try them in the new
MuseScore V2.0 beta1. However, if you use them, make sure to
safe your work. There's no guarantee the plugins won't corrupt
your score.

If you prefer courtesy accidentals to be in brackets change line 29 of
addCourtesyAccidentals.qml to:

    property bool useBracket: true

If you have comments and/or suggestions, please tell me.
