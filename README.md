courtesyAccidentals for MuseScore v3
====================================

Three plugins for MuseScore version 3.0.5 or higher to add or remove courtesy accidentals.
* addCourtesyAccidentals will add accidentals only in the following measure
* configCourtesyAccidentals can be configured via a dialog window
* removeCourtesyAccidentals will remove any accidental, that is not needed according to standard rules.

**Please note that you need MuseScore v3.0.5 or higher for these plugins to work.**

Because of limitations of the plugin framework, some of the custom options in the GUI version are still disabled for v3.
